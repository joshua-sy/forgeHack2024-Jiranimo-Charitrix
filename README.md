# What is Charitix
Charitix was our solution to promoting volunteering and dontating opportunities to Atlassian employees. Our application allows its users to view events from Humanitix on their confluence pages.

# When was this app developed
This application was developed during ForgeHack 2024 hosted by Atlassian. The event was held for 3 days.

# What was used to develop Charitix
We developed Charitix using Forge by Atlassian. We learnt how to use forge during the the workshop in day 1. We then developed it in Day 2.

# Special Thanks 
Special thanks to Tharushi for developing the backend. Her commits won't be seen here but definitely in the other repo below. Also thanks to Zane for creating the figma file and canva slides for the presentation. Thanks to Lara Holmes for making the event lively and giving us free Atlassian merch during the hackathon. Finally, thank you to Jemma S and Esha Sood for organising the ForgeHack 2024. Hoping to attend another forgeHack :D


# THIS IS THE OFFICIAL GITHUB FILE FOR JIRANIMO CHARITRIX
We built most of the backend in the other repo which was transferred to here. Most of the frontend was built in this repo. We had trouble developing the backend and frontend at the same time in confluence when we were trying to deploy. Our quick solution was to create two different forge apps where one forge app was used to develop the backend and the other was used to develop the frontend. This repo was used to develop the frontend. The backend code was copy pasted into this repo from the other repo.
